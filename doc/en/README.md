# vLocal Project Specification

The vLocal project is composed of several components, some are legacy and some are more modern elements of an overall online identity platform concept, with the integration and missing pieces making up the more interesting parts of this project.

The specification is broken down along those component lines with the following (with links to individual local specification files):
